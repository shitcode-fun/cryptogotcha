# CryptoGotcha (GOTCHA)

CryptoGotchi is an innovative web application that merges the nostalgia of classic virtual pet games with the financial advantages of blockchain technology. Built on the Base blockchain, users can hatch, raise, and trade unique CryptoGotchi pets, whose attributes and rarity are dynamically generated using smart contracts. Users engage in crypto-farming activities to earn rewards, which can be reinvested in nurturing their pets or trading for other valuable assets within the ecosystem. The game promotes community interaction and allows adventures that resonate with both millennials and Gen Z, paving the way for a vibrant marketplace and social environment.
